For **Fall 2017** I'll be teaching at 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM on MWF. Outside of my listed office hours the best way to reach me is email.

- Office Hours
    - Wednesday: 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM
    - Thursday: 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM

Currently, all office hours are "open" office hours, meaning you can stop by for class questions, advising, or really anything at all. If necessary, I may alter the schedule to specify certain times for certain activities.

If you need to schedule a meeting outside of these times, please send an email suggesting two possible times, on two different days. (A total of four suggested times.) Preference for time-slots directly adjacent to current office hours.
