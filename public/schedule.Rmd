For **Fall 2017** I'll be teaching at 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM on MWF. Outside of my listed office hours the best way to reach me is still email.

- (Tentative) Office Hours
    - Wednesday: 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM
    - Thursday: 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM

Currently, all office hours are "open" office hours, meaning you can stop by for class question, advising, or really anything at all. If necessary, I may alter the schedule to specify certain times for certain activities.
