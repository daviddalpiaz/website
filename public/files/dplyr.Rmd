## `dplyr` Information

## Overview

dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

* `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables.
* `select()` picks variables based on their names.
* `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
* `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
* `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation "by group". You can learn more about them in `vignette("dplyr")`.

# Manipulating Rows with `filter()`

- How can we find results from IPF meets that use only "raw" equipment?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
powerlifting %>% 
  filter(Federation == "IPF", Equipment == "Raw")
```

***

# Manipulating Columns with `select()`

- How can we remove information about 4th attempts? (For raw lifters in the IPF.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
powerlifting %>% 
  filter(Federation == "IPF", Equipment == "Raw") %>% 
  select(-Squat4Kg, -Bench4Kg, -Deadlift4Kg)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
powerlifting %>%
  filter(Federation == "IPF", Equipment == "Raw") %>% 
  select(-contains("4Kg"))
```

***

# Creating Columns with `mutate()`

- How can add a variable about a lifter's total to bodyweight ratio? (For raw lifters in the IPF.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
powerlifting %>%
  filter(Federation == "IPF", Equipment == "Raw") %>% 
  mutate(total_bw_ratio = TotalKg / BodyweightKg)
```

***

# Summarizing Data with `summarise()`

- How can we find the average best squat, best bench, and best deadlift by age class? (For male raw lifters in the IPF open division.)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
powerlifting %>%
  filter(Federation == "IPF", Equipment == "Raw", 
         Division == "Open", Sex == "M") %>%
  group_by(AgeClass) %>%
  summarise(ave_squat = mean(Best3SquatKg, na.rm = TRUE),
            ave_bench = mean(Best3BenchKg, na.rm = TRUE),
            ave_dead  = mean(Best3DeadliftKg, na.rm = TRUE))
```

***

# Reordering Data with `arrange()`

- How can we find the best raw lifter in the database? (Who has the highest Wilks?)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
powerlifting %>% 
  filter(Equipment == "Raw") %>% 
  arrange(desc(Wilks))
```

***

# Tasks

- How much does single-ply equipment effect deadlift results?
  - Find all results from IPF competitions with squat, bench, and deadlift contested.
  - Group by `Sex` and `Equipment`
  - Calculate mean and standard deviation of `Best3DeadliftKg` within these groups.
- Convert the entire dataset from kilograms to pounds. (Or just the raw IPF data so you can work with a smaller dataset.)
