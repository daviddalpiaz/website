Hello and welcome to my webzone! I'm currently an [Associated Assistant Professor](https://stat.osu.edu/people/dalpiaz.14) and [Data Analytics Program Specialist](https://data-analytics.osu.edu/) for the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu/) at [**The** Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/).

After a BS in Mathematics from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), I did a Phd in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with [Ping Ma](http://malab.uga.edu/). I then spent four years as a Visiting Assistant Professor, then Lecturer and MS Academic Advisor, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am now an [Adjunct Teaching Assistant Professor](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/dalpiaz2) for the Department of Statistics at the University of Illinois where my course [Statistical Modeling in `R`](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/) is part of the online [Master of Computer Science in Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/masters-in-computer-data-science). Yes, I spent a lot of time at UIUC. [I’m still mad they don’t use UIUC anymore.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_currently_registered_Internet_domain_names) Oh well. Go Illini!
