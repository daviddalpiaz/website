Hello and welcome to my webzone! I'm currently an [Associated Assistant Professor](https://stat.osu.edu/people/dalpiaz.14) and [Data Analytics Program Specialist](https://data-analytics.osu.edu/) for the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu/) at [**The** Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/).

After a BS in Mathematics from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), I did a PhD in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with [Ping Ma](http://malab.uga.edu/). I then spent four years as a Visiting Assistant Professor, then Lecturer and MS Academic Advisor, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am now an [Adjunct Teaching Assistant Professor](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/dalpiaz2) for the Department of Statistics at the University of Illinois where my course [Statistical Modeling in `R`](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/) is part of the online [Master of Computer Science in Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/masters-in-computer-data-science). Yes, I spent a lot of time at UIUC. [I’m still mad they don’t use UIUC anymore.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_currently_registered_Internet_domain_names) Oh well. Go Illini!

## Contact

The two best ways to reach me are by email or in person. I am currently without an office phone, but you would get a much faster response via email anyway.

- Office: 114 Pomerene Hall
- OSU Email: [dalpiaz.14@osu.edu](mailto:dalpiaz.14@osu.edu) [primary]
- UIUC Email: [dalpiaz2@illinois.edu](mailto:dalpiaz.14@illinois.edu) [for Illinois business]

## Schedule

For the **Spring 2019** semester I will be teaching:

- **STAT 3202:** Tuesday and Thursday, 8:00 AM - 9:20 AM
- **STAT 4194:** Tuesday and Thursday, 12:45 PM - 2:35 PM

Outside of my listed office hours, the best way to reach me is [email](contact.html).

### Office Hours

- **Wednesday:** 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- **Thursday:** 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM

Currently, all office hours are "open" office hours, meaning you can stop by for class questions, or really anything at all, but questions about class will be given priority.

If you need to schedule a meeting outside of these times, please send an email suggesting two possible times, on two different days. (A total of four suggested times.) Preference for time-slots directly adjacent to current office hours or directly after a class. Please also indicate a brief agenda for the meeting. If possible, I will also try to resolve the issue immediately via email.

## Teaching

### Ohio State University

- **STAT 3202:** Introduction to Statistical Inference for Data Analytics [[**Spring 2019**](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat3202-sp19//)] [[Autumn 2018](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat3202-au18/)]
- **STAT 4194:** Data Analytics Capstone [[**Spring 2019**](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat4194-sp19/)]

### University of Illinois 

- **STAT 400:** Statistics and Probability I [[Spring 2018](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat400sp18/)] [[Fall 2017](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat400fa17/)]
- **STAT 420:** Statistical Modeling in `R` [[Summer 2017](https://www.coursera.org/learn/stat-420/)]
    - Taught as part of the Master of [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) in Data Science program in collaboration with [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/masters-in-computer-data-science). I currently maintain an open-source textbook, [Applied Statistics with `R`](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/) for use with the course. Soon to partially be released as public MOOCs on the Coursera platform.
- **STAT 432:** Basics of Statistical Learning [[Spring 2018](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat432sp18/)] [[Fall 2017](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat430fa17/)]
    - Covers the entirety of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in `R`](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). I currently maintain an open-source supplemental textbook, [`R` for Statistical Learning](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/r4sl/) which focuses on using `R` to perform statistical learning techniques.

## Writing

- [Applied Statistics with `R`](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/)
    - Still a work in progress, but the content coverage is more or less solidified. Provides an introduction to both `R` and regression modeling for students with undergraduate experience in probability and statistics. Currently in use for [STAT 420](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2018/spring/STAT/420) both in-person and online at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/) for the Departments of [Statistics](http://www.stat.illinois.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/).
- [`R` for Statistical Learning](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/r4sl/)
    - Currently undergoing considerable changes and developments. Originally intended to be supplemental notes to [ISL](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) in order to provide additional `R` code and `rmarkdown` examples, the text is starting to become a complete reference text for [STAT 432 - Basics of Statistical Learning](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat430fa17/) at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/) for the Departments of [Statistics](http://www.stat.illinois.edu/). Target audience is advanced undergraduate students in statistics with previous experience with `R` and regression.
