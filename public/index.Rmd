## Schedule

- **Summer 2017:** I'm teaching online, so I have no set schedule. Your best bet for reaching me is through email. I will hold some advising specific office hours the week before class starts.
- **Fall 2017:** I'll be teaching at 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM on M-W-F. Outside of my listed office hours (which are TBD) the best way to reach me is still email.

## "Blog"

Maybe someday I'll make this site into a proper blog, but for now, I'll just collect various things I've written here. They'll mostly be advice or information for students in statistics courses. Things that if I write them down, I won't have to repeat constantly.

- [Help! I'm Not Good with Computers]()
- [How to Use Office Hours]()
- [Letters of Recommendation]()
- [Unknown Unknowns]()
- [What **is** a Distribution?]()
