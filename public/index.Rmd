Hello and welcome to my webzone! 

I am currently a [Teaching Assistant Professor](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/dalpiaz2) for the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).

After a BS in [Mathematics](https://math.illinois.edu/) at Illinois, I completed a PhD in Statistics at Illinois with [Ping Ma](http://malab.uga.edu/). I then spent four years as a Visiting Assistant Professor, then Lecturer and MS Academic Advisor for Statistics @ Illinois.

I recently spent a year as an [Associated Assistant Professor](https://stat.osu.edu/people/dalpiaz.14) and [Data Analytics Program Specialist](https://data-analytics.osu.edu/) for the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu/) at [**The** Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/). Go Bucks? While away from Illinois, I was an [Adjunct Teaching Assistant Professor](https://stat.illinois.edu/directory/profile/dalpiaz2) for Statistics @ Illinois where my course [Statistical Modeling in R](http://stat420.org) is part of the online [Master of Computer Science in Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/masters-in-computer-data-science). 

But now I have returned to spend even more time at Illinois. Yes, I have spent a lot of time at UIUC. [I’m still mad they don’t use UIUC anymore.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_currently_registered_Internet_domain_names) Oh well. Go Illini!

## Contact

***

The best way to reach me is by email, which I check far too frequently. I have a phone, but honestly, I don't know the number and I respond faster to email anyway. 

- Office: Room 36, 703 S. Wright
- Email: [dalpiaz2@illinois.edu](mailto:dalpiaz.14@illinois.edu)

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/daviddalpiaz/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/daviddalpiaz).

## Schedule

***

For the **Fall 2019** semester I will (tentatively) be teaching:

- **STAT 432:** Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 11:00 AM - 11:50 AM
- **STAT 432:** Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 02:00 PM - 02:50 PM

### Office Hours

My **Fall 2019** office hours are to be determined.

Currently, all office hours are "open" office hours, meaning you can stop by for class questions, or really anything at all, but questions about class will be given priority.

If you need to schedule a meeting outside of these times, please send an email suggesting two possible times, on two different days. (A total of four suggested times.) I have a preference for time-slots directly adjacent to current office hours or directly after a class. Please also indicate a brief agenda for the meeting. If possible, I will also try to resolve the issue immediately via email.

## Teaching

***

### University of Illinois 

- **STAT 400:** Statistics and Probability I [[Spring 2018](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat400sp18/)] [[Fall 2017](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat400fa17/)]
- **STAT 420:** Statistical Modeling in R [[Summer 2017](https://www.coursera.org/learn/stat-420/)]
    - Taught as part of the Master of [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) in Data Science program in collaboration with [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/masters-in-computer-data-science). I currently maintain an open-source textbook, [Applied Statistics with R](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/) for use with the course. Soon to partially be released as public MOOCs on the Coursera platform.
- **STAT 432:** Basics of Statistical Learning [[**Fall 2019**](http://stat432.org/fall-2019)] [[Spring 2018](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat432sp18/)] [[Fall 2017](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat430fa17/)]
    - Covers the entirety of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). I currently maintain an open-source supplemental textbook, [R for Statistical Learning](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/r4sl/) which focuses on using R to perform statistical learning techniques.

### Ohio State University

- **STAT 3202:** Introduction to Statistical Inference for Data Analytics [[Spring 2019](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat3202-sp19//)] [[Autumn 2018](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat3202-au18/)]
- **STAT 4194:** Data Analytics Capstone [[Spring 2019](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat4194-sp19/)]

## Writing

***

- [Applied Statistics with R](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/)
    - Still a work in progress, but the content coverage is more or less solidified. Provides an introduction to both R and regression modeling for students with undergraduate experience in probability and statistics. Currently in use for [STAT 420](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2018/spring/STAT/420) both in-person and online at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/) for the Departments of [Statistics](http://www.stat.illinois.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/).
- [R for Statistical Learning](https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/r4sl/)
    - Currently undergoing considerable changes and developments. Originally intended to be supplemental notes to [ISL](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) in order to provide additional R code and R Markdown examples, the text is starting to become a complete reference text for [STAT 432 - Basics of Statistical Learning](http://stat432.org) at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/) for the Departments of [Statistics](http://www.stat.illinois.edu/). Target audience is advanced undergraduate students in statistics with previous experience with R and regression. 

### Notebooks

This idea is stolen from both [Alex Reinhart](https://www.refsmmat.com/) and [Cosma Shalizi](http://bactra.org/notebooks/). My current use case might be slightly different than theirs. They also have clearly written a lot more.
