## Blog

Maybe someday I'll make this site into a proper blog, but for now, I'll just collect various things I've written here. They'll mostly be advice or information for students in statistics courses. Things that if I write them down, I won't have to repeat constantly.

- [How to Use Office Hours](posts/office.html)
- [Unknown Unknowns](posts/unknowns.html)

<!-- - [Letters of Recommendation]() -->
<!-- - [Help! I'm Not Good with Computers]() -->
<!-- - [What **is** a Distribution?]() -->
